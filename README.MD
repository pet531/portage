Bash script to conveniently write to package.use per package, before invoking emerge.
Needs equery, eix, dialog.

Usage:
	pkguse pkg

You may need to adjust .dialogrc colors, so that all menus/cursors are clearly visible.
Put .dialogrc included here to ~/ for the color scheme with which everything is visible, at least on my machine :)
